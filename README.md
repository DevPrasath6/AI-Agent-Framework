# AI Agent Framework — Complete Scaffold

This archive contains a full scaffold for the AI Agent Framework with Django control plane, orchestration, messaging, OpenVINO optimization hooks, observability, and example agents. All files are placeholders and meant to be extended.

Build-Your-Own AI Agent Framework

Build an AI Agent framework (not just an app) that can orchestrate agentic workflows from input to
output without using existing agent frameworks like crew.ai, AutoGen, or n8n. The framework should
support allowing the definition of agentic workflows as a composition of task flows. These must then be
executable. Must be able to monitor and audit them. Apache projects can be used for orchestration,
messaging, and storage.

High-Level Guidelines

• Core Features:
• Define and execute task flows (DAG or state machine).
• Support input handlers, tools/actions, and output actions.
• Include memory, guardrails, and observability (logs, metrics).

• Architecture:
• Ingress (REST/queue) → Orchestrator → Executors → State/Memory.
• Use Apache components (Kafka, Airflow, Camel, etc.) for messaging and orchestration.

• Use Apache components (Kafka, Airflow, Camel, etc.) for messaging and orchestration.

• Intel Tech:
• Develop and benchmark on Intel® DevCloud.
• Optimize any ML models (LLMs, re-rankers, OCR) with Intel® OpenVINO™.

• Deliverables:
• Framework SDK with APIs for flows, tools, and policies.
• At least two reference agents demonstrated real workflows.
• Design doc + performance benchmarks (pre/post optimization).

• Performance Targets:
• Reliable execution with retries and timeouts.
• Demonstrate Intel optimizations if ML is involved.

• Stretch Goals:
• Multi-agent collaboration, reflection loops, human-in-the-loop steps.
