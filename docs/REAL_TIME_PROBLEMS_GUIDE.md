3. **Monitor Performance**: Track agent effectiveness and resource usage

## Example Problem Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Cryptocurrency Trading Bot
```python
# Set up real-time crypto trading analysis
data_source = "Binance WebSocket API"
update_frequency = "Every second"
agents = ["price_analysis", "sentiment_analysis", "risk_management"]
output = "Buy/sell signals with confidence scores"
```

### Scenario 2: Smart Factory Monitoring
```python
# Monitor industrial equipment in real-time
data_source = "Industrial IoT sensors via MQTT"
update_frequency = "Every 100ms"
agents = ["anomaly_detection", "predictive_maintenance", "quality_control"]
output = "Equipment health alerts and maintenance schedules"
```

### Scenario 3: Social Media Crisis Detection
```python
# Detect and respond to social media crises
data_source = "Twitter Streaming API + News feeds"
update_frequency = "Real-time stream"
agents = ["sentiment_analysis", "trend_detection", "crisis_classification"]
output = "Crisis alerts with severity levels and response recommendations"
```

## Performance Considerations

### Throughput Optimization
- Use async/await for concurrent processing
- Implement connection pooling for API calls
- Batch processing where possible
- Optimize agent execution paths

### Memory Management
- Implement sliding window data structures
- Clear old data periodically
- Use efficient data formats (e.g., numpy arrays)
- Monitor memory usage in production

### Scaling Strategies
- Horizontal scaling with multiple agent instances
- Load balancing across agents
- Database optimization for state storage
- Caching frequently accessed data

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics
- **Processing Latency**: Time from data receipt to result
- **Throughput**: Messages/events processed per second
- **Error Rates**: Failed processing attempts
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, network utilization

### Alerting
- Set up alerts for system failures
- Monitor agent performance degradation
- Track data source connectivity issues
- Alert on business logic anomalies
