## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Stock Market Agent
```python
# Monitor AAPL stock in real-time
from demo_real_time_problems import RealTimeMarketAnalysisAgent
import yfinance as yf

agent = RealTimeMarketAnalysisAgent()
# Stream stock data and get buy/sell signals
```

### Example 2: IoT Sensor Monitoring
```python
# Detect equipment anomalies
from demo_real_time_problems import RealTimeAnomalyDetectionAgent

agent = RealTimeAnomalyDetectionAgent(threshold=2.0)
# Monitor temperature sensors and alert on anomalies
```

### Example 3: System Health Monitoring
```python
# Monitor server performance
from demo_real_time_problems import RealTimeLogAnalysisAgent

agent = RealTimeLogAnalysisAgent()
# Track error rates and response times
```

## üìö Learning Path

### Step 1: Run the Demo (You Just Did This!)
```bash
python demo_real_time_problems.py
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Problem Domain
- **Financial Markets** - If you're interested in trading/investing
- **IoT/Sensors** - If you work with hardware/manufacturing
- **Social Media** - If you want to analyze trends/sentiment
- **System Monitoring** - If you're in DevOps/infrastructure

### Step 3: Get Real Data
1. Pick a free data source from the list above
2. Sign up for API access (most have free tiers)
3. Install required Python libraries
4. Test data connection

### Step 4: Create Your Agent
1. Copy one of the example agents from `demo_real_time_problems.py`
2. Modify the analysis logic for your specific problem
3. Add your data source integration
4. Test with real data

### Step 5: Deploy and Scale
1. Use the Django API for web access
2. Set up Kafka for high-throughput scenarios
3. Add monitoring and alerting
4. Scale horizontally with multiple agents
